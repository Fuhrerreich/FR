_Don't waste time filling in things not needed, if it is typo then clearly we don't need your save game, OS or anything like that, just give us the event and the typo. Use your common sense in working out what information is needed, though if unsure, er on the side of more rather than less._

_Fill in the placeholders below. Delete any headings and placeholders that you do not fill in.
PLEASE CHECK IF THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REPORTED BEFORE!
Make sure your title explains the issue well._

_Before you report a crash (CTD) issue, please ensure the following:_
1. _You were not running any other mods (FR music mod is fine, others not made by the KR team are not - yes, this includes graphical mods and things you believe are harmless). No, disabling the mods for a game where you've been running with them active previously doesn't count. If you want to report it anyhow, that's fine, but please be honest about their use and know that we might reject the report if you're using mods we're unfamiliar with._
2. _That you have a save to include which crashes consistently (meaning: on each reload, within a reasonable time)_
3. _Make sure you include the game log, found in C:\Users\NAME\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\logs_
4. _That you have the checksum on hand - this is the four-letter code at the bottom of your title menu, and is vital for us to know if your files match ours._

_Thanks for your patience! We'll do our best to address the isssue, if we can._
